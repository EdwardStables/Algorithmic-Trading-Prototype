# Algorithmic-Trading-Prototype
A proof of concept prototype of the trading platform for the Imperial College Algorithmic Trading Society. Run the 'source.py' file to launch the platform. This requires that you have all relevant modules installed.

This is being developed in python using PyQt4 for GUI design. 

When launching the program; 'Data>Add Data File' can be used to import datasets into the program. 2 datasets are included in the 'data' folder for convenience.  

Please remember that this is designed as a proof of concept and therefore there are several bad practices present, for example, use of 'execfile()' when running an algorithm.
